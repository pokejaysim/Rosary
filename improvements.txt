Here are some general improvements for your web project, assuming it's a simple static site:

1.  **Organize Assets into Dedicated Directories:**
    *   Create a `css/` directory for all your stylesheets (e.g., `css/style.css`).
    *   Create a `js/` directory for all your JavaScript files (e.g., `js/script.js`).
    *   Create an `images/` directory for all your image assets.
    *   Update your `index.html` to link to these new paths.

2.  **Separate CSS from HTML:**
    *   If you have any `<style>` tags or inline `style` attributes in your `index.html`, move that CSS into a separate file like `css/style.css`. This improves maintainability and readability.

3.  **Separate JavaScript from HTML:**
    *   If you have any `<script>` tags with JavaScript code directly in your `index.html`, move that JavaScript into a separate file like `js/script.js`. This also improves maintainability and allows for better caching.

4.  **Add a `README.md` File:**
    *   Create a `README.md` file in the root directory. This file should describe your project, how to set it up, how to run it, and any other relevant information.

5.  **Enhance `.gitignore`:**
    *   Your `.git/` directory is present, which is good. Consider adding more common entries to your `.gitignore` file to prevent unnecessary files from being committed (e.g., editor configuration files, build artifacts, `node_modules` if you introduce npm/yarn).

6.  **Add a Favicon:**
    *   Consider adding a `favicon.ico` or `favicon.png` file to the root directory and linking it in your `index.html`'s `<head>` section. This provides a small icon for browser tabs.

Example of an improved structure:

```
/Users/jason/Documents/GitHub/Rosary/
├───.git/
├───.gitattributes
├───.gitignore  (new or updated)
├───index.html
├───README.md   (new)
├───css/
│   └───style.css (new)
├───js/
│   └───script.js (new)
└───images/
    └───(your images here)
```
